# minesweeper
Function that takes a grid from user of # (represents a mine) and - (represents a mine-free spot) and returns a grid where each dash is replaced by a digit, indicating the number os mines immediately adjacent to the spot.

User would be prompted at the beginning to enter how many rows and columns wants for the grid and after to enter symbol # and - to assigned the spots inside the grid for mines and mine-free cells.

After the program would run through the grid and returns a new one with digits and # symbols.
The # would represent the mines and digits would represent how many adjacent mines are to that cell.
